              For several years, my friend and I were using an excel spreadsheet
              filled with columns of random words and concepts. You would read
              across the row and try to create an idea by jamming together words
              that don&apos;t really belong together. This was a great way to
              make wild ideas that I never would have come up with otherwise, so
              I decided to make a simple web app that displayed each row of the
              spreadsheet on the screen with buttons to individually randomize
              each word. I converted each column into an array of strings, and
              used a simple{" "}
              <code>array[Math.floor(Math.random(array.length))]</code> to
              randomly select a word from the array and display it to the
              screen.
              <br />
              <br />
              This was my first real &quot;web app&quot;, and I learned a lot
              about JS, CSS, and the DOM. I was super proud of my creation at
              the time, even though it took longer than I&apos;d like to admit
              lol. It was the seed for the idea that would become ideaisland
              several months later. In hindsight, before turning it into a
              larger application, I should have shared this tool with others to
              see if they found value in it, in which I would have discovered
              that making ideas without a defined problem was a lousy way to
              innovate. You live and you learn though right? ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

                        I enjoy making ideas with the combinatorial thinking
                        technique.

                        P5.js makes for a decent JS &quot;framework&quot; for
                        creating simple websites, although I&apos;d never use it
                        again.

                        So much practice with DOM manipulation with javascript.

                        I learned a lot about randomizing arrays of values.

                        An excel sheet can be upgraded into a simple web app to
                        improve the UX in certain situations.

                      <li>
                        Although its fun making ideas with this platform, the
                        best way to make innovations that are useful is to find
                        actual problems in the world, then find solutions to
                        them. Making random solutions without first having a
                        real problem is a recipe for disaster.
