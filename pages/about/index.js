                    and helped over a dozen get jobs in the community by working

                    handle the snow and ice of Colorado and decided to move to
                    rainy Seattle with my best friend. My last job in the
                    biology field was monitoring and preventing bioterrorism in

                    switch things up and teach myself web development in June of
                    2021. Many factors weighed into that decision, arthritis
                    from pipetting being one, but most importantly I was not
                    able to express my creativity as often as I&apos;d liked. It
                    proved to be a fantastic decision, and I&apos;ve loved every
                    minute of my learning thus far.
