I'm tired of scrolling feeds and consuming content without ever contributing anything myself. I mean, sure, I might "like" a few posts here and there, but let's be real; I've been a digital lurker, and it’s time to make a change.

Starting today, more blog posts on this site, more tweets, and more comments on others’ content. Heck, I could even start a YouTube channel. The possibilities are endless, I'm ready to create! With each post, I’ll get more practice, and learn about myself.

Creating on the internet isn't just about sharing my own work. It's also about engaging with the work of others and contributing to the online community. That means leaving comments, sharing content I enjoy, and participating in online discussions.

I'm not the only one who has been guilty of being a digital lurker. Many of us consume content on the internet without ever engaging or contributing our own thoughts and ideas. Recently, I noticed how few people actually comment on YouTube. As an example, Mr. Beast's [new video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CTp1a-aCUM&ab_channel=MrBeast) has 27 million views but only 56,854 comments, at the time of writing. This means that for every 500 people that watch the video, only one person leaves a comment.

I’ve left maybe five comments on YouTube videos in my entire life, and that has to change. From now on, I will leave a compliment if the video is good, or leave a yelp review when the [Thai food](https://www.yelp.com/biz/silver-spoon-thai-restaurant-and-bar-lynnwood?osq=silver+spoon) is incredible. I'll join the conversation on that r/React Reddit thread and I’ll disagree publicly on Twitter over CSS.

I'm excited to see what kind of impact I can have by being more active online. I'm sure that I'll learn a lot, and I hope that my own contributions will be valuable to others. I'm looking forward to seeing what the future holds, and I hope that you'll join me on this journey.
